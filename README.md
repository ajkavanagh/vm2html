# vw2html - VimWiki to HTML conversion script

It is a page formatter for the `Vimwiki2HTML` command that is provided as part
of the Vimwiki mini-wiki for Vim (and Neovim).

There is an executable generated by this application:

* `vm2html` -- callable from `:Vimwiki2HTML` and related
  commands.

## Link Conversion

Conversion of the `[[link]]` and `[[link|desc]]` links is very naive at the
moment.  It doesn't look at intersite links, nor does it deal with anchors (a
`#anchor` in the link) and it always appends `.html` to the link on conversion.
If this becomes a problem, I'll make the link converter smarter.  Obviously, if
you use it, and it bothers you, then let me know, or (if you so wish) you can
provide a PR.
